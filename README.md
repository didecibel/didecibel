I am attempting to make a paraphonic synthesiser from the Jen SX2000 schematics.
My goal is to make a simple, easily reparable. It is through hole component. Almost everything is still available online.
I am not a pro so there could be some mistake. I have not made it yet. These are just the kicad files.
Debug will follow.
I'll take my time.
